<p>One of the most important elements of any Concerto display is the use of eye-catching, vivid images.  Graphics can take the form of event flyers, original artistic creations, or visual announcements.  But if you are submitting content that is graphical in nature, you'll want to pay careful attention to the size, colors, fonts, and composition of your content.</p>
<p>Most graphical content on the average Concerto screen will appear in one or more designated "graphics" blocks on the screen.  These blocks are generally in a 4:3 aspect ratio (4" wide and 3" tall, or some multiple of that ratio).  That means that the recommended size for most graphical content should preserve these relative dimensions.  The best resolution for an image you may submit to the system is <b>1024 pixels by 768 pixels</b>, which is a common resolution of many computer monitors.  If you don't stick to a 4:3 aspect ratio, Concerto displays will take the larger dimension and shrink the entire image to fit in each graphics block.  For this reason, you should avoid creating content that is really narrow or really tall.</p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasize the parts of the slide, such as the name of an event, your club or organization, or the time and place of an event in a large, readable font face.</li>
<li>Leave about 10% free space on all sides of the slide for margins.  This space will likely get cut off during broadcast (see the graphic to the right).</li>
<li>Use fonts at size 20pt or higher.  Stick to sans-serif fonts such as Arial, Helvetica, and Verdana (not serif fonts such as Times New Roman or Book Antiqua.</li>
<li>Try to stay away from super-bright colors such as pure white, bright yellow, and hot pink.  If you have to use a bright color, use it very sparingly.</li>
<li>Don't use copyrighted content unless you get permission beforehand from the copyright holder.  There might be an exception if you use fair-use materials.  If you can't tell if something is copyrighted or not, don't use it.</li>
<li>Remember that each slide you submit will remain up on a display for the number of seconds you specify as the duration.  The average duration we recommend is 8 seconds per piece of content.  If that's not enough time to comunicate all the info you need to get across, consider breaking up the information into multiple slides.</li>
</ul>
