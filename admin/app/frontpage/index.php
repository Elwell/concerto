<h2>Log in to the left to use Concerto.</h2>
<p>The purpose of Concerto is to communicate events, announcements, and other information submitted by RPI organizations and individuals to the campus community through a variety of digital means. This is primarily accomplished by presenting the events and announcements in a dynamic bulletin-board format on a large LCD screen. Integration with existing services, such as dining halls and the Institute Events Calendar, is also dead simple - Concerto simply retrieves content from them. The content submission system, accessible to all RPI community members with unique campus user accounts, is simply a web interface for uploading announcements and graphical materials to the system. Content on each screen can be controlled by the people who are most directly connected to that display.</p>
