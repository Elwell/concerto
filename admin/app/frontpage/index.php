<p>Concerto introduces an entirely new way of reaching out to the rest of RPI's campus.  With Concerto, you can communicate events, announcements, and other information to campus through a variety of digital means.  Several high-resolution displays, similar to the one above, have been deployed in high-traffic areas of RPI's Troy campus.  Integration with existing services, such as dining halls and the Institute Events Calendar, is also dead simple - Concerto simply retrieves content from them.  Content on each screen can be controlled by the people who are most directly connected to that display.</p>
