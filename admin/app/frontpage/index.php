      <p class="fp">Concerto introduces an entirely new way of reaching out to the rest of RPI's campus.  With Concerto, you can communicate events, announcements, and other important information to campus through a variety of digital means.</p>
      <p class="fp">A growing number of high-resolution displays have been deployed in high-traffic areas of RPI's Troy campus.  These screens pull from content categories ("feeds") open to submissions from the campus community.</p>
      <p class="fp">Content on each screen can be controlled by the people who are most directly connected to that display.</p>
